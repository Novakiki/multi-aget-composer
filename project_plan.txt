Project: AI Agent Coordination System
==========================================

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
-----------------
A modular, self-organizing system for AI agents to collaborate on code development
with built-in quality monitoring and coordination.

Objectives:
â€¢ Enable seamless AI agent collaboration
â€¢ Maintain code quality automatically
â€¢ Scale from small to large projects
â€¢ Minimize setup and maintenance

Core Functions:
â€¢ Real-time code monitoring
â€¢ Agent task coordination
â€¢ Quality assurance
â€¢ Progress tracking

2. KEY PRINCIPLES
----------------
â€¢ Bayesian Learning: 
  - System learns from successful patterns
  - Adapts thresholds based on project needs
  - Updates beliefs about code quality
  - Improves predictions over time

â€¢ Modular Design:
  - Independent modules with clear boundaries
  - Plug-and-play components
  - Easy to extend or modify
  - Self-contained units

â€¢ Simple Setup:
  - Sensible defaults
  - Minimal configuration needed
  - Auto-discovery of modules
  - Immediate functionality

â€¢ Clear Communication:
  - Structured message format
  - Visual status indicators
  - Automated reporting
  - Clear handoffs

3. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
---------------------------
Phase 1: Basic Setup
-------------------
1. Folder Structure Creation:
   ```
   ./create_project.sh
   â””â”€â”€ Creates basic folder structure
   â””â”€â”€ Sets up configuration files
   â””â”€â”€ Initializes monitoring system
   ```

2. Configuration Setup:
   ```json
   {
     "project_name": "example",
     "modules": ["ui", "api", "data"],
     "agents": {
       "agent_1": {"role": "frontend"},
       "agent_2": {"role": "backend"}
     }
   }
   ```

3. Quality Baseline:
   â€¢ Default thresholds for code quality
   â€¢ Basic linting rules
   â€¢ Documentation requirements
   â€¢ Test coverage expectations

Phase 2: Agent Coordination
--------------------------
1. Communication Protocol:
   ```
   [TIMESTAMP] AGENT_ID: ACTION
   Example:
   [2024-11-27 10:00] Agent1: Starting UI module
   [2024-11-27 10:05] Agent2: Reviewing API changes
   ```

2. Task Management:
   â€¢ Task queue system
   â€¢ Priority handling
   â€¢ Dependency tracking
   â€¢ Progress monitoring

3. Quality Control:
   â€¢ Automated code reviews
   â€¢ Style enforcement
   â€¢ Performance checks
   â€¢ Security scanning

4. AGENT COORDINATION
-------------------
â€¢ Each agent has a specific role
â€¢ Agents communicate through shared logs
â€¢ Progress tracked automatically
â€¢ Quality checks run continuously

5. MONITORING SYSTEM
------------------
Status Indicators:
ðŸ”´ Critical issues
ðŸŸ¡ Important improvements
ðŸ”µ Style suggestions

File Status:
ðŸŸ¢ Available for work
ðŸŸ¡ In progress
ðŸ”´ Needs review
