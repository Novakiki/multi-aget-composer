## Agent Spawning Strategy

Agents are spawned based on:
- Pattern complexity (40%)
- Insight depth (30%)
- Meta-cognitive value (30%)

This prepares for future coordination by:
1. Optimizing resource usage
2. Enabling pattern sharing
3. Preparing for API pooling 

## Tuning Spawn Behavior

Adjust `spawn_config.py` for different use cases:
- Therapy: More sensitive to patterns
- Analysis: More depth required
- Custom: Create your own profiles 

## Future Considerations

The system may evolve to handle different needs:
- Therapeutic exploration
- Analytical depth
- Resource optimization

Rather than implementing profiles now, we'll:
1. Watch how the system is used
2. Note where adjustments are needed
3. Let real use cases guide development
