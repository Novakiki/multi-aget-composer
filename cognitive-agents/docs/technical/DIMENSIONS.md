# Multi-Dimensional Agent Architecture

## Overview
The system implements a three-dimensional agent architecture:
- Vertical: Depth of analysis
- Horizontal: Domain specialization
- Diagonal: Cross-cutting synthesis

## Dimension Interactions

### 1. Vertical-Horizontal
- Surface emotional patterns feed into deeper emotional analysis
- Behavioral observations evolve into meta-behavioral insights
- Somatic awareness deepens into body-mind connections

### 2. Horizontal-Diagonal
- Emotional patterns track through behavioral changes
- Somatic patterns integrate with emotional depth
- Behavioral patterns reveal meta-cognitive insights

### 3. Vertical-Diagonal
- Deep patterns emerge across domains
- Meta-patterns reveal systemic insights
- Evolution tracking shows pattern development

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Agent Creation
```python
def create_multi_dimensional_agent(
    vertical_level: str,
    horizontal_domain: str,
    diagonal_capability: Optional[str] = None
) -> Agent:
    """Create an agent with specific dimensional capabilities."""
    pass
```

### 2. Pattern Integration
```python
def integrate_dimensional_patterns(
    vertical_patterns: List[Pattern],
    horizontal_patterns: List[Pattern],
    diagonal_patterns: Optional[List[Pattern]] = None
) -> IntegratedInsights:
    """Synthesize patterns across dimensions."""
    pass
```

### 3. Resource Optimization
- Spawn agents based on content needs
- Scale dimensions independently
- Share insights across dimensions
