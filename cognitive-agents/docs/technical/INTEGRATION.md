# Integration Guide

## Core Components

### 1. Cognitive Agent
The primary interface for thought processing:
```python
from cognitive_agents import CognitiveAgent

agent = CognitiveAgent("Custom Role")
result = await agent.process_thought("Your thought here")
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition
Track and analyze patterns:
```python
# Access pattern memory
patterns = agent.pattern_memory[-5:]  # Recent patterns

# Check pattern relevance
is_relevant = agent._is_pattern_relevant(pattern, thought)
```

### 3. Resource Awareness
Control API usage:
```python
# Configure spawn thresholds
agent.max_depth = 2  # Limit recursion
```

## Best Practices

1. **Honor Natural Timing**
   - Don't force quick insights
   - Let patterns emerge naturally
   - Respect processing depth

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Use pattern memory
   - Limit unnecessary spawning
   - Cache common patterns

3. **Pattern Building**
   - Start with simple thoughts
   - Let patterns accumulate
   - Watch for emergent understanding

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Custom Processing
```python
class CustomAgent(CognitiveAgent):
    async def process_thought(self, thought: str):
        # Your custom logic here
        result = await super().process_thought(thought)
        return self._enhance_result(result)
```

### 2. Pattern Extension
```python
agent.pattern_memory.extend([
    {"pattern": "Growth mindset",
     "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()}
])
```

### 3. Integration Points
- Pattern recognition
- Belief analysis
- Resource management
- Natural unfolding

## Philosophical Foundation

While our system uses standard AI components, its architecture is inspired by key principles:

1. **Consciousness-Inspired Design**
   - Agents aware of their processing depth
   - Pattern recognition across levels
   - Integration of insights across layers

2. **Natural Pattern Processing**
   - Patterns stored and recognized
   - Connections tracked over time
   - Relevance assessed contextually

3. **Depth-Aware Analysis**
   - Processing at multiple levels
   - Integration across layers
   - Context-aware responses

Our technical implementation, while using conventional tools, strives to respect these deeper principles through:
- Thoughtful agent spawning
- Pattern recognition and storage
- Multi-level processing
- Resource-aware decisions

## System Insights

### The Simplicity Paradox
Our system's response to "Ok" revealed a profound insight:
- Just as humans often over-analyze simple situations
- Our AI system spawned 9 agents to understand a two-letter word
- This mirrors the challenge of accepting simplicity

This isn't just a bug to fix, but a feature to learn from.
It reminds us that true intelligence includes:
- Knowing when not to over-analyze
- Accepting simple truths
- Respecting natural timing
