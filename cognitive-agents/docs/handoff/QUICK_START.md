# Quick Start Guide

## Core Concept
The system enables natural learning through:
- Question evolution
- Pattern emergence
- Meta-awareness

## Key Files to Understand
1. **Meta Learning**
```python
cognitive_agents/memory/meta_learning.py
# Shows how meta-awareness emerges
```

2. **Natural Connection**
```python
cognitive_agents/memory/natural_connection.py
# Shows how understanding flows
```

3. **Tests**
```python
tests/memory/test_meta_learning.py
tests/memory/test_natural_connection.py
# Show system in action
```

## Running Tests
```bash
# Test meta learning
pytest -v -s tests/memory/test_meta_learning.py

# Test natural connection
pytest -v -s tests/memory/test_natural_connection.py
```
